# Ultimate Self-Study Guide to Learning Pure Math

Here are the topics I’ll be covering in this guide:

1. Real Analysis
2. Linear Algebra
3. Point Set Topology
4. Complex Analysis
5. Group Theory / Ring Theory
6. Galois Theory
7. Differential Geometry
8. Algebraic Topology

These topics are roughly arranged in order of increasing difficulty. It’s fine to skip around a lot (I definitely did when I was learning this stuff) but a lot of these topics have earlier topics as prerequisites. For example, Topology and Group Theory are prerequisites to learning Algebraic Topology.

Some notes:

1. This is 4 years of content. It covers the standard undergraduate math curriculum. So it’s not really something that can be studied in a few days’ time. Each subject would take 4 months to really study well.
2. Do as many problems as possible. So for each topic, I’ve included resources (most of which are freely / cheaply available) that include a lot of practice problems.
3. Re-read these books many times. I normally only really understand a textbook after having read it 4 times. Most people are the same.

Let’s get into it!

# Real Analysis

- Book: [Understanding Analysis by Stephen Abbott](https://www.amazon.ca/Understanding-Analysis-Stephen-Abbott/dp/1493927116) – A beginner-friendly introduction to rigorous calculus, offering clear explanations and an intuitive approach.
- Videos: Lectures by Francis Su – Engaging and accessible lectures that clarify abstract concepts with real-world examples. [Playlist here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0E754696F72137EC).

# Linear Algebra

- Book: [Linear Algebra Done Right](https://linear.axler.net/LADR4e.pdf) by Sheldon Axler – Focuses on vector spaces and linear transformations, offering a fresh perspective without relying heavily on determinants.
- Videos: Sheldon Axler’s Playlist – A concise lecture series that complements the book’s content. [Playlist here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGAnmvB9m7zOBVCZBUUmSinFV0wEir2Vw).

# Point Set Topology

- Online Notes: MAT327 Course Notes – Comprehensive notes with problems, ideal for building a strong foundation in topology. [Available here](http://www.math.toronto.edu/ivan/mat327/?resources).

# Complex Analysis

- [Introductory Book: Visual Complex Functions](https://www.amazon.ca/Visual-Complex-Functions-Introduction-Portraits/dp/3034801793): An Introduction with Phase Portraits by Elias Wegert – Provides an accessible and visual approach to understanding complex functions.
- Advanced Books:
    - [Complex Analysis by Stein and Shakarchi](https://www.amazon.ca/Complex-Analysis-Elias-M-Stein/dp/0691113858) – A more technical and rigorous text for deeper insights into the subject.
    - [Complex Analysis by Ahlfors](https://www.amazon.ca/Complex-Analysis-Introduction-Analytic-Functions/dp/0070006571) – One of my favorite math books of all time 🙂
- Videos: [ETH Zurich Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiud-28tsatLRRGqO_Eg_x0S4LVyxuV5p) – A structured series of lectures covering fundamental and advanced topics.

# Group Theory

- Book: [Topics in Algebra](https://www.amazon.ca/Topics-Algebra-I-N-Herstein/dp/0471010901) by I.N. Herstein (Chapter 2) – An accessible yet rigorous introduction to the foundations of group theory.
- Videos: [Lectures by Benedict Gross](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzVTusWerVcIzewg9dQxOKl9_62kTgOgI) – Clear and engaging lectures that explore group theory concepts step by step. [](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLelIK3uylPMGzHBuR3hLMHrYfMqWWsmx5)One of my favorite lecture series!

# Galois Theory

- Notes: [Galois Theory Notes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07499) by Tom Leinster – A concise and insightful guide to understanding Galois theory.

# Differential Geometry

- Book: [Introduction to Differentiable Manifolds and Riemannian Geometry by Boothby](https://www.amazon.ca/Introduction-Differentiable-Manifolds-Riemannian-Geometry/dp/0121160513) – A thorough introduction to the concepts and tools of differential geometry, suitable for advanced learners.
- Videos: [Online Lectures by Fredrich Schuller](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFeEvEPtX_0S6vxxiiNPrJbLu9aK1UVC_). These were the lecture videos that first got me interested in math!

# Algebraic Topology

- Book: [Algebraic Topology by Allen Hatcher](https://pi.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/AT/ATpage.html) – A classic, freely available text offering a detailed introduction to the subject.
- Videos: [Lectures by Pierre Albin](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpRLWqLFLVTCL15U6N3o35g4uhMSBVA2b) – An accessible and well-organized lecture series covering key topics. [Playlist here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL41FDABC6AA085E78).

To understand how software will change, we can benefit from studying how technology has changed other industries. History tends to rhyme, if you listen.

  

Before the internet, media behaved very differently—it was expensive to create. You had to pay people to make content, edit it, and distribute it. Because content was expensive to create, it had to make money. And consumers paid—newspapers, magazines, books, cable, and pay per view. Warren Buffett famously loved newspapers—and who wouldn’t love a predictable subscription business with local monopolistic dynamics?

  

When the internet happened, media companies viewed it as a way to reach broader audiences and reduce their distribution costs. But what no one saw coming was that the internet not only reduced distribution costs to zero, but it also drove the cost of creating content to zero. User generated content flourished, and when content doesn’t cost anything to create, it no longer has to make money. How does content behave when it no longer has to make money? The relaxation of this economic constraint led to a Cambrian explosion–you can take a picture of a cup of coffee, post it to a million views or none at all and the market clearing price is still met. This produced a deluge of content that none of us could reasonably consume. This necessitated products to direct attention, merchandise this content, and route us effectively–we understand these now as user-generated content platforms.

  

These platforms completely T-boned media companies. As a media company, you were competing for the same attention of users, but with a strictly higher COGS. The more people you had on your payroll that were creating content, the more exposed you were to being flanked by user-generated content platforms. Structurally, investing in media has been a losing value proposition ever since and value creation has shifted entirely to the platforms that control distribution.

  

Software is expensive to create. You have to pay people to create it, maintain it, and distribute it. Because software is expensive to create, it has to make money. And we pay for it–software licenses, SaaS, per seat pricing, etc. Software margins have historically been an architectural envy–90+% margins and zero marginal cost of distribution.

  

Software is expensive because developers are expensive. They are skilled translators–they translate human language into computer language and vice-versa. LLMs have proven themselves to be remarkably efficient at this and will drive the cost of creating software to zero. What happens when software no longer has to make money? We will experience a Cambrian explosion of software, the same way we did with content.

  

Vogue wasn’t replaced by another fashion media company, it was replaced by 10,000 influencers. Salesforce will not be replaced by another monolithic CRM. It will be replaced by a constellation of things that dynamically serve the same intent and pain points. Software companies will be replaced the same way media companies were, giving rise to a new set of platforms that control distribution.

  

SaaS, ARR, magic numbers–these are all shorthand to understand the old model of business building in software, one where the expense associated with creating software was a moat. The invisible hand has been stayed in software for a long time, but LLMs will usher in its swift, familiar corrective force. Majoring in computer science today will be like majoring in journalism in the late 90’s.

# 软件的终结（The End of Software）

为了理解软件将如何变化，我们可以通过研究技术如何改变其他行业来获益。历史往往会押韵，只要你愿意去听。[[1]]

在互联网出现之前，媒体的运作方式非常不同——内容的创作成本很高。你必须付钱给人来生产内容、编辑内容并进行分发。因为内容的生产成本高，它就必须赚钱。消费者也确实为此付费——报纸、杂志、书籍、有线电视、按次付费点播等。沃伦·巴菲特曾经非常喜欢报纸——谁会不喜欢一种可预测的订阅生意、同时还具备本地垄断的结构性优势呢？[[2]]

互联网出现后，媒体公司把它视为触达更广泛受众并降低分发成本的方式。但没人预料到的是，互联网不仅把分发成本降到了零，还把内容创作的成本也推向了零。用户生成内容迅速繁荣；当内容几乎不花钱就能被创造出来时，它也就不再需要赚钱。[[3]]

当内容不再需要赚钱时，它会呈现出怎样的形态？这一经济约束的放松引发了一场“寒武纪大爆发”——你拍一张咖啡杯的照片，发出去可能有一百万浏览，也可能无人问津，但市场出清价格仍然成立。这带来了海量内容的洪流，我们任何人都不可能合理地全部消费。于是，就需要有产品来引导注意力、对这些内容进行变现（或商品化）、并把我们有效地“路由”到合适的信息——我们如今把它们理解为用户生成内容平台。[[4]]

这些平台对传统媒体公司造成了彻底的“T 型撞击”。作为媒体公司，你在争夺用户注意力时，要与平台竞争，但你的商品销售成本（COGS）却严格更高。你工资单上从事内容创作的人越多，就越容易被用户生成内容平台从侧翼包抄。从结构上看，从那以后投资媒体就成了一种长期处于劣势的价值命题，而价值创造几乎完全转移到了掌控分发的平台手中。[[5]]

软件同样昂贵：你必须付钱给人来开发、维护和分发。因为软件的生产成本高，它也必须赚钱。我们也为软件付费——软件许可、SaaS、按席位计费等。历史上，软件的利润率一直令人艳羡——90% 以上的利润率，且分发的边际成本为零。[[6]]

软件之所以昂贵，是因为开发者昂贵。开发者是熟练的翻译者——他们把人类语言翻译成计算机语言，反之亦然。大语言模型（LLMs）已证明自己在这件事上异常高效，并将把软件的创造成本驱动到零。当软件不再需要赚钱时，会发生什么？我们将像内容行业那样，经历一次软件的“寒武纪大爆发”。[[7]]

《Vogue》并不是被另一家时尚媒体公司取代的，而是被一万名网红取代的。Salesforce 也不会被另一个单体化的 CRM 所取代；它会被一组“星座式”的东西取代——这些东西动态地满足同样的意图与痛点。软件公司将以媒体公司类似的方式被替代，从而催生一批新的平台来掌控分发。[[8]]

SaaS、ARR、magic numbers——这些都是用来理解软件旧商业模式的速记：在那个模式里，开发软件的成本本身就是护城河。长期以来，软件行业里的“看不见的手”被按住了；但 LLM 将带来它迅速而熟悉的校正力量。今天去主修计算机科学，就像 90 年代末去主修新闻学一样。[[9]]

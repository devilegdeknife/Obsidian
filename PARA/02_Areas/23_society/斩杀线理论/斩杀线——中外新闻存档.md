Why China Is Suddenly Obsessed With American Poverty

State media, embracing the gaming phrase “kill line,” is asserting China’s political superiority over the United States, deflecting focus on China’s own economic challenges.
By [Li Yuan](https://www.nytimes.com/by/li-yuan)

Jan. 13, 2026

Chinese commentators are talking a lot these days about poverty in the United States, claiming China’s superiority by appropriating an evocative phrase from video game culture.

The phrase, “kill line,” is used in gaming to mark the point where the condition of opposing players has so deteriorated that they can be killed by one shot. Now, it has become a persistent metaphor in Communist Party propaganda.

“Kill line” has been used repeatedly on social media and commentary sites, as well as news outlets linked to the state. It has gained traction in China to depict the horror of American poverty — a fatal threshold beyond which recovery to a better life becomes impossible. The phrase is used as a metaphor to encompass homelessness, debt, addiction and economic insecurity. In its official use, the “kill line” hovers over the heads of Americans but is something Chinese people don’t have to fear.

The depiction of the United States as a place where economic hardship is deep and widespread has been a go-to of official Chinese messaging for years. But the use of the “kill line” phrasing and imagery is new. The power is in the simplicity of what it describes: an abrupt threshold where misery begins and a happy life is irreversibly lost. The narrative is meant to offer China’s people emotional relief while attempting to deflect criticism of its leaders.

The worse things look across the Pacific, the logic of the propaganda goes, the more tolerable present struggles become.

It’s not a coincidence that there is a swell of these messages now. China’s economic growth is half what it once was. Youth unemployment is high. Familiar paths to security — stable jobs, rising property values, steady upward mobility — have become less predictable. For many families, the margin for error feels thinner than it once did.

In an essay published online in late December, the legal blogger Li Yuchen argued that the appeal of the “kill line” idea was its convenience. It allowed Chinese people to condemn a distant system while avoiding uncomfortable questions about their own lives, he wrote.

The term “functions less as an analytical tool than an emotional interpreter,” he wrote. His essay was removed by censors, joining a long list of content erased for questioning official economic narratives.

The fact is that societal inequality is a problem in both China and the United States. And the American economy no doubt leaves many people in fragile positions. The causes are complex.

Yet in China, poverty is experienced and perceived differently. In most Chinese cities, street begging and visible homelessness are tightly managed, making them far less prominent in daily life. Many urban residents encounter such scenes only through foreign reporting, rebroadcast by Chinese state media, about the United States and other places.

Economic insecurity remains widespread in China. Some 600 million people, or about 40 percent of the population, make about $1,700 a year. Rural pensions often amount to only $20 or $30 a month, and a serious illness can send families into a financial crisis. That fear of running out of money is one reason China has among the world’s highest household savings rates. But such pressures are portrayed as part of a culture of endurance and responsibility that leaves families prepared to overcome unpredictable life events.

For older Chinese, the enlistment of American poverty in service of domestic politics is familiar. During the Cultural Revolution, a famous slogan proclaimed that “happy Chinese people deeply cared about the American people living in misery,” even as most Chinese themselves were living in poverty.

When I was growing up in China in the early 1980s, my family subscribed to China Children’s News, which ran a weekly column with a simple slogan: “Socialism is good; capitalism is bad.” It described seniors in American cities scavenging for food, and homeless people freezing to death. Those stories were not invented, but they lacked context and were presented as the dominant experiences in American society. Much of Chinese society was still closed off from the world, and reliable information was scarce.

That many people accepted such narratives was hardly surprising. What’s striking is that similar portrayals continue to resonate today, when access to information is relatively much greater despite state control.

The formula is simple: magnify foreign suffering to deflect from domestic problems. That approach is taking shape today around the “kill line” metaphor.

The phrase is believed to have been first popularized in this new context on the Bilibili video platform in early November by a user known as Squid King. In a five-hour video, he stitched together what he claimed were firsthand encounters of poverty from time he spent in the United States. His video used scenes of children knocking on doors on a cold Halloween night asking for food, delivery workers suffering from hunger because of their meager wages and injured laborers discharged from hospitals because they could not pay.

The scenes were presented not as isolated cases but as evidence of a system: Above the “kill line,” life continues; below it, society stops treating people as human.

The narrative spread beyond the Squid King video, and many people online repeated his anecdotes. Essays on the nationalist news site Guancha and China’s biggest social media platform, WeChat, described the “kill line” as the “real operating logic” of American capitalism.

Others cited examples of Western journalism that they felt presented the America-China contrasts. A [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/49274d50-d781-45d5-a4cd-9ab00986d033) article published on Dec. 24 about Connecticut’s wealth gap — affluent Greenwich, struggling Bridgeport — was recast in Chinese media. Even a modest financial shock, such as a missed paycheck, the loss of health care benefits or a sudden expense, can trigger a rapid downward spiral.

Another widely circulated example drew on “Hillbilly Elegy,” the 2016 memoir by Vice President JD Vance. People online highlighted his account of selling plasma while struggling with student debt. If even a future national leader had to drain his body to stay afloat, Chinese commentaries asked, what chance does an ordinary American have?

By late December, the “kill line” framework had gained official momentum. Beijing Daily and Southern Daily, both state-run outlets, launched several “hot topics” on the Weibo platform that usually help draw wider attention. Guancha published more than a dozen commentaries in less than two weeks applying the metaphor to American poverty, health care and working conditions. The site later included “kill line” in its roundup of the year’s top news, linking it to critiques of President Trump’s first year back in office.

In early January, Qiushi, the Chinese Communist Party’s leading theoretical journal, published a commentary addressing the “kill line” as a structural feature of U.S. capitalism. A term borrowed from gaming culture had entered sanctioned political language.

In many of the commentaries, anecdotes about Americans experiencing abrupt financial crises are followed by comparisons with China. Universal basic health care, minimum subsistence guarantees and poverty alleviation campaigns are cited as evidence that China does not permit anyone to fall into sudden distress.

“China’s system will not allow a person to be ‘killed’ by a single misfortune,” one commentary from a provincial propaganda department states.

Many readers expressed shock at American poverty and gratitude for China’s system. “At least we have a safety net,” said one commenter.

Not everyone has accepted the narrative. Some commentators even applied the “kill line” language to domestic policies, including local actions in northern Hebei Province that sharply raised winter fuel costs for rural households.

“A topic does not gain traction simply because people are foolish,” one person wrote on WeChat. “Often, it spreads because confronting reality is harder.”

The title of the article: “The American kill line is not about America.”

China obsesses over America’s “kill line”

## It is easier to talk about American harshness than Chinese malaise

IN CHINESE VIDEO games the “kill line” describes a perilous position for combatants. Once their virtual health falls below this line, it takes just a single punch or shot to be eliminated. Strikingly, use of the term has spread in the past month, migrating from gamers’ chatrooms to political agitprop. The “US kill line” has become shorthand for what, supposedly, is wrong with America and right with China. In the process, though, it has also drawn attention to some of China’s own economic vulnerabilities.

The new, politicised meaning of kill line (_zhanshaxian_) was coined by a Chinese biology student in Seattle. In a series of live streams on Bilibili, a video-blogging app, he claimed to work in a morgue where he had encountered the bodies of homeless people who had frozen outside and gang members felled by violence. Although of dubious veracity, his reflections cast America in the harshest light: a place where a single misfortune—perhaps a car crash or an illness or the loss of a job—can lead to ruin.

Never mind, for a moment, that such a depiction is a crude exaggeration of American life. It resonated with many in China. State media regularly portray America as a deeply unequal, dangerous country. But the kill line phrase was fresh, even edgy. Many of the Seattle student’s live streams were censored by Bilibili for their graphic nature. Yet in the whirling ecosystem of Chinese social media, others made posts about his posts, and within days the “US kill line” had become widely known. Commenters marshalled evidence of the American hellscape. They recycled stories of people needing urgent care who refused ambulances because of their cost and of well-paid software engineers who lost their jobs and wound up homeless.

By late December officials noticed that they had a winning message. State media started to produce serious pieces about the kill line, armed with data. Many noted that some [770,000 Americans are now homeless](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2024/12/31/homelessness-rises-to-a-record-level-in-america). They also referred to a Federal Reserve report that 37% of American adults cannot cover a $400 emergency expense with their savings. And some cited a new estimate that an American family of four needs an eye-watering $137,000 annually to stay out of poverty. On January 4th even _Qiushi_, a leading Communist Party journal, published its interpretation, writing that the kill line reflects America’s “institutional arrangements that systematically place capital security and returns ahead of workers’ survival and dignity”.

No doubt life can be tough in America. But the kill line greatly overstates the fragility of existence there. Homelessness is a stain on the country, but it remains an extreme outcome, affecting less than 0.05% of the population on a chronic basis. As for those who struggle to cover emergency expenses, analyses that factor in deferred discretionary spending put the number at about 10%, not 37%. And economists have thoroughly debunked the claim that $137,000 marks America’s true poverty line. Families can, and do, get by on much less.

But the Chinese fascination reveals something telling about their own worries. In an online essay last month, Wei Zhou, an author using a pen name, argued that the upswell in discussion about America’s deficiencies stemmed partly from China’s own anxieties about its slowing growth. Although censors often curtail criticism of China, “one can talk freely under the guise of discussing America”, he wrote. Some commentators may not be doing this deliberately but rather engaging in a form of psychological projection, or “talking about others while thinking about oneself”, as Wei Zhou put it.

People in China have much to be glum about these days. Property owners have seen the [values of their homes fall](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2025/12/30/chinas-property-woes-could-last-until-2030) by about 20% from their peak five years ago. University graduates are entering a [forbidding job market](https://www.economist.com/china/2025/11/19/china-has-too-many-university-grads-and-too-few-jobs-for-them), with the youth unemployment rate at 17%. Blue-collar workers are eking out tiny wage gains, a sharp regression from the heady norm of the previous decade.

But are single misfortunes somehow less devastating in China than in America? It depends. To China’s credit, its medical and drug costs are lower than the sky-high charges in America, so illnesses or accidents may be less damaging financially. (A bigger problem is the availability of good health care, especially in smaller cities.) Business failures, by contrast, can be debilitating. Without well-developed personal-bankruptcy laws, it is much harder to recover from bad investments in China than in America. China is not safe from a kill line: it just shows up in other ways.

## Locked in

In any case, the kill line implies that people have already lost a good deal. Americans mostly fear being knocked down a few rungs of the economic ladder when disasters occur. In China many are fighting to gain a foothold in the first place. Parents and teachers heap pressure on children from a young age to perform well in tests. Companies in every sector compete ferociously, only to see their profit margins collapse. Workers put in long hours but find that intense effort is met with diminishing returns. All the while the economy is sagging, eroding the opportunities that once seemed boundless.

A recent study in the _China Leadership Monitor_, an online journal published by the Hoover Institution in California, points to a dramatic slowdown in the growth of China’s middle-income population since 2018. Unsurprisingly, surveys have also detected a clear rise in pessimism over the past decade. The gloom is less about the risk of precipitous decline than a sense of creeping stagnation. Gamers have a term for this, too. For China, the hazard is not so much the kill line but _ruansuo_, or “softlock”—a predicament when players are trapped alive but can no longer progress, no matter how hard they try.■

# “斩杀线”上的美国政治困局

来源：求是网 作者：钟言 2026-01-04 22:09:47

最近，一个源自网络游戏的术语——“斩杀线”，正在中文互联网上流行，成为观察美国社会困境的一个形象隐喻。它描述的不是赤贫，而是一种抗风险能力被压榨到极致的普遍状态：众多虽有工作但积蓄微薄的美国家庭，一旦遭遇失业、重病等意外，财务状况便可能“血条见底”，触发失去住房、信用破产的灾难性坠落。官方数据显示，2024年美国无家可归者超过77万人，同比激增18.1%，其中不乏有正式工作者，显示其社会安全网存在巨大漏洞。“斩杀线”形象揭示了美国社会结构性的经济脆弱。

当一个社会有如此庞大人群生活在“坠落”的恐惧中时，巨大的政治需求便会产生。近年来声势浩大的“让美国再次伟大”（简称MAGA）运动，正是对这一社会问题的政治回应之一。然而，深入分析其施政路线可发现，MAGA运动虽然以解决民众的经济不安全感为主要动员口号之一 ，但其政治承诺与“斩杀线”所代表的生存焦虑之间，产生实质性脱节。

MAGA运动系统地将经济民生领域的公共诉求，引导并重构为文化身份领域的群体对抗。观察其政策与宣传不难看出，该运动的核心策略，是将实在的经济压力，置换为对特定文化群体的指责：将困境归咎于“窃取工作”的非法移民、“不公平竞争”的海外国家以及漠视民众的国内“精英”。它提供的更多是一种身份认同和情感宣泄，让支持者感到自己被看见、被代表。于是，修建边境墙、发动贸易战、掀起反“政治正确”的文化斗争……这些举措主要功能在于树立敌人、强化群体认同，是有力的政治动员，却无法切实改变普通家庭的经济处境。

MAGA运动在其支持者内部，始终未能就如何解决民众面临的经济问题形成真正共识。最近，作为MAGA运动重要风向标的“美国转折点”组织，在亚利桑那州凤凰城举行年度集会。在此次年会上，MAGA阵营内部矛盾公开激化，暴露出多重裂痕：一边高喊“反建制”，却因与“爱泼斯坦案”的牵连，使其道德号召力大打折扣；一边宣称“美国优先”，内部却在是否无条件支持以色列等问题上激烈内讧；更深层的分裂则触及国家认同：一方坚持基于宪法原则的公民身份，另一方则抱持更为激进、带有种族排外色彩的基督教民族主义理念。这些争吵恰恰说明，一场以身份政治划线的运动，其内部联盟是十分脆弱的，分歧与路线之争，使其难以在复杂的经济社会议题上形成统一、有效的解决方案。

MAGA运动虽以“美国优先”口号吸纳了民众在医疗、就业、住房等领域的普遍不满，但其政治实践却回避了这些民生压力的深层根源，实则搁置了社会保障、财富分配等实质性改革。这导致美国政治陷入一种空转状态：政治动员声势浩大，但普通民众的生计改善却停滞不前。这种政治回应能力与真实社会需求之间的系统性背离，正是美国社会撕裂持续加深、难以弥合的结构性矛盾。

“斩杀线”现象所揭示的，是一种冷酷的“资本优先”制度逻辑：在这一逻辑下，制度安排系统性地将资本安全与增值回报，置于劳动者生存保障与尊严之前。这导致当个体因遭遇风险而经济失能时，体系优先考量的是如何隔离金融风险、保全资本价值，而非为民众提供足以恢复和缓冲的实质性支持，甚至不惜以部分社会成员的牺牲为代价。正因如此，任何试图加固社会安全网、优化财富分配的真改革，一旦触动这一根本利益结构，便必然举步维艰。

# ExecPlan Index

This file anchors ExecPlan usage for complex features and significant refactors. Write an ExecPlan before implementation and keep it updated as decisions change.

Each ExecPlan should include:
- Overview and success criteria
- Architecture options and trade-offs
- Step-by-step execution plan
- Dependencies and risks
- Test cases and acceptance criteria

Add a dated entry for each plan, for example:
- 2026-02-11 — Knowledge Base YAML Tagging Plan (`PLAN.md`)
